# pmc_id_converter_demo-binder
Demonstrating of pmc_id_converter for ID converter between PMID, PMCID and DOI, via the MyBnder service.  
Click 'launch' badge above to get started.

See [suqingdong's repo for pmc_id_converter here](https://github.com/suqingdong/pmc_id_converter) for more about the command line/Python utility.

I use Jupyter Notebooks here with some code to demonstrate how easy it is to use and how you can combine `pmc_id_converter` use in with Python coding and Jupyter convenience to more easily mine or collect information you need about scientific references at PubMed Central and PubMed.
